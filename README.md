# DatabaseManagementSystems_Practicum
Final practicum for CS5200: Database Management Systems. The goal is to use raw (synthetic) data to design, implement, and analyze a relational database with a star schema and fact tables

Learning goals from the assignment: 
import data from multiple sources into a cloud-hosted relational data warehouse
construct fact tables within a star schema for analytics
apply data partitioning and indexing to improve query performance
create reports from the data warehouse using SQL and Markdown

**NOTE** The data used is fabricated, and this repository is meant to showcase skills in relational database design
